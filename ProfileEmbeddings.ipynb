Barnridge sat out one game in  because of a sore foot.Barnidge is a tall, lanky tight end/H-back prospect who catches the ball well, has good speed for his size and has the work ethic as well as the frame to improve as blocker but it's critical that he continues to add weight and gets stronger at the point of attack. In addition, he lacks ideal explosiveness so he projects as a fifth round pick.\",\n          \"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He isn't the most polished route-runner but is able to separate from coverage because of his outstanding combination of size and speed.

He made some spectacular catches but was inconsistent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Coates is another vertical threat who caters to QB Ben Roethlisberger's big arm.
